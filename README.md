# Meteoriod Destroyer

Our love of playing classic games was brought to reality by being able to actually re-create one of the classics using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. We recreated the classic game Asteroids with some newly added features like a high score for anyone who can top that score and newly added visuals.
